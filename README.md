# Web of Doors

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.4.

It is a project to help me learn how to use angular. The site is a website of doors and cupboards that people can navigate around and open doors. 
Each door shall have an API running that does something cool and interesting. 

When i have decided on the API's that I shall be running I shall update this readme with more details
